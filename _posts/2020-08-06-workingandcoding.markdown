Hi, it can be hard sometimes to get coding done while working and even harder to get it done at work if your workstation at work is very restricted on what can be done on the workstation. Still working like most because, I perform a task that is consider essential. Long hours. But at the end of the day, nothing beats picking up your laptop and creating something new. I enjoy algorithms and very love solving puzzles with code. Long story short no matter the long hours completed at work, coding for me will also get an hour or two after the work day.
