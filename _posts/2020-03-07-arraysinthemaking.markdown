Arrays are in my opinion code pockets that can be used to hold data and retrieved for use within your code. For example array1 = [x, y, z]. This array holds 3 values that can be used. Now, in order to count the spots in this array we would normally start counting from 1, but in computer terms, 0 is the first digit. so this array will actual be counted as 0 , 1, 2. So within our code, if we needed to retrieve the item y, we would say array1.at(1) => this would retrieve y because it is at postion 1.

Now if we wanted to create an empty array with out values of any size, we would perform this like so array2 = Array.new(3). This creates an array for us with 3 spaces which we can use to hold an assign values. Now to assign a value to this array we would do this: array2 = Array.new(1, "I am here"). as we can see I have assigned the phrase to spot 1 in arrays.
