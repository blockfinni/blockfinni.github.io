I am currently a Database Administrator. It's fun and very rewarding to me but I wanted something more. I work closely with a lot of Software Developers in my career feild and, I decided to make the plunge into building a webpage along with a Database. I'm good with the Database and I can get too busy with building them; So I wanted a guide to lead me along this nee Journey in Software Development.
